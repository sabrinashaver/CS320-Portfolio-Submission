CS320: Software Test, Automation QA

To ensure that my code is both functional and secure, I follow a structured testing process throughout development. Writing unit tests allows me to verify that each method performs as intended and that any changes do not break existing functionality. I also use automated testing frameworks, such as JUnit, to validate logic efficiently and consistently. To improve security, I apply secure coding practices, including input validation and proper error handling, and I stay aware of common vulnerabilities like injection or improper data exposure. Regular code reviews and static analysis tools also help identify potential weaknesses early in development.

Understanding user needs begins with analyzing requirements and considering how users will interact with the software. I focus on translating high-level requirements into specific, testable features that align with user goals. During design and testing, I try to think from the user's perspective about how the application should behave, what data is most important, and how to make interactions intuitive. Feedback and testing scenarios help refine these features so that the end product provides real value and a positive user experience.

When designing software, I start by breaking down the problem into small, manageable components. I often use object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and modularity to keep the design organized and easily maintainable. I plan out classes, methods, and relationships before coding to ensure scalability and clarity. I also consider testing early in the design phase, thinking about how each part of the program can be validated. This structured, iterative approach helps create software that is reliable, maintainable, and adaptable to future changes.
